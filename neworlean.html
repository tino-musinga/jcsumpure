        <p class="bio">
            
            Students, Mr. Saeed Dupree (Biology and Chemistry), Ms. Delaney Hill (Biology), Ms. Tay-Keara Bristol (Biology), 
            and Mr. Tanaka Mbavarira (Computer Engineering) from the College of STEM were chosen to present their research at the 
            National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE) 50th Annual Meeting 
            in New Orleans, LA; September 11 – 14, 2023. Additionally, they all were awarded the Advancing Science Conference Grant (ASCG). 
             As a 2023 ASCG recipient, these students were identified as “one of the
            country’s best and brightest upcoming scientists.”
            In addition to presenting their undergraduate research, students volunteered in several NOBCChE conference activities, attended 
            NOBCChE’s career fair, and networked with peers and senior scientists from around the country.  These students also attended 
            the anniversary gala where they participated in the celebration of 50 years of NOBCChE building an “eminent cadre of scientists
             of color.”  This black-tie event featured special guest speaker, Dr. Mae Carol Jemison, an American engineer, physician, and 
             the first African-American woman to travel into space.  This was an amazing experience for these students at the NOBCChE 50th 
             Annual Meeting, and they would like other students just like them to participate in future scientific conferences. All students
              are members of the Minority–Polymer Undergraduate Research Experiences (M-PURE) program under the leadership of Dr. Tracy 
              Brown–Fox. Also, all students’ research projects were supported by NSF Award: #2101209
