        <p class="bio">
            As both a research scientist with the M-PURE (Brown-Fox) group and the lab
            coordinator/Chemical Hygiene Officer for the JCSU College of STEM, I live on both sides of the
            lab bench - out front and behind the scenes.
            I took my undergraduate degree from N. C. State University, majoring in polymer and color
            chemistry. While at State, I conducted research with Dr. Samuel Hudson, studying sustainable
            deacetylation techniques for converting chitin to chitosan, a biopolymer with various important
            pharmaceutical, water treatment and biomedical applications. I also worked on a mini-project
            examining the extent to which flame retardancy of certain organic and synthetic textiles is
            enhanced by chitosan as a char-forming agent in conjunction with commercial flame retardant
            chemicals.
            Growing up close to nature helped foster a deep awareness of how safety and sustainability are
            central to practicing science, both now and into the future. An environmental toxicology minor
            and feeling that academic settings were my natural fit led me to Central Piedmont Community
            College as a lab technician/teaching assistant. A whirlwind of lab preps, lab planning and other
            interesting happenings followed. Following this memorable time (extended by a pandemic), I
            was brought into the JCSU and M-PURE families through the grace of Dr. Tracy Brown.
            Serendipity is wonderful.
            I am an active member of the Polymer Chemistry, Chemical Health and Safety, and History
            Divisions of the American Chemical Society. When I’m not keeping things moving in the labs (in
            the College of STEM and BNACC), or researching (often some interesting scientific literature), I
            enjoy family, friends, learning (about food, languages and cultures), reading and music (diverse
            genres of both), photography, exploring (outdoors and generally), following Charlotte FC, and
            developing a recent interest in the history of science. Always excited about what’s new, and
            opportunities for working with you!
